# FormList Manipulator

This SKSE plugin allows you to add Forms to FormLists at game startup using configuration files. 

With this mod, you can get rid of conflicts between mods that modify FormLists, and thus avoid creating compatibility patches. Examples of such situations are mods that add new plants to plant, add toys and gifts, new character voices, trophies, hair colors and races for head parts, etc.

As of version 1.3.0, you can use Mod Events to update FormLists on demand during the game.

## Config Files

Configuration files can have any name, but they must be INI files whose name ends with _FLM. Example: Toys_FLM.ini.

Or they can be any INI files located in the "FLM" directory.
Configuration files are processed in alphabetical order. First from the Data directory, then from the Data\FLM.

Keys: Alias, Group, ModEvent, FormList, Plant, BToys, GToys, HairColors, AtronachForge, AtronachForgeSigil are not case-sensitive.

##  General usage

```FormList = FList|Form, Form, #Group, etc```

where,
* FList can be: EditorID or FormID~ESP or Alias.
* Form can be: EditorID or FormID~ESP.
* FormID - record ID. Example: 0xD80 or 0x03008246 or 0xFE00080A or 0x8246 (You no longer need to remove any digits from FormID, the plugin will do it automatically).
* ESP - name of the plugin with extension. Not required for base plugins and DLC. Example Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp. Not case-sensitive.
* EditorID - form editorID.

FList  is skipped if is not found. Form is skipped if it already exists in FormList or is not found.


## Mod Events
```ModEvent = EventName|FList|Form, Form, #Group, etc```

where,
* EventName is a string of letters A-Z, a-z.
* The rest the same as for general use.
* There can be multiple entries for the same Mod Event.

Adding an event is skipped if it does not contain a single valid FormList and Form. After receiving the event, FLM will add Forms to the indicated FormLists and send a new event with the name of the received event with "OK" (EventNameOK) appended (string sent: EventName|Added Forms|Form duplicates, value sent: Added Forms). The entire procedure is written to the log.

##  Aliases

```Alias = NameForAlias|FList, FList, etc```

Aliases are collections of FormLists. To use an Alias add the # sign before its name. Aliases are processed at the beginning of the configuration file, regardless of their position in the file. Only for FormList and ModEvent keywords.
##  Groups

```Group = NameForGroup|Form, Form, etc```

Groups are collections of Forms. To use a Group add the # sign before its name. Groups are processed at the beginning of the configuration file, regardless of their position in the file. For FormList, ModEvent, BToy, GToy, HairColors, AtronachForge, AtronachForgeSigil keywords.

## Simplified usage for Plants:

```Plant = Form|Form```

where,
* first form is for Ingredient/Alchemy Item/Activator,
* second for Flora/Tree/Misc/Activator/Container.
* If you specify a different type of Form, a warning will be thrown into the log, but the Form will be added.

## Simplified usage for Boy's Toys:

```BToys = Form, Form, #Group, etc```

## Simplified usage for Girl's Toys:

```GToys = Form, Form, #Group, etc```


## Simplified usage for Hair Colors:

```HairColors = Form, Form, #Group, etc```

## Simplified usage for Atronach Forge:

```AtronachForge = Form|Form```

where,
* first form is for Recipe,
* second for Result.

## Simplified usage for Atronach Forge with Sigil Stone:

```AtronachForgeSigil = Form|Form```

where,
* first form is for Recipe,
* second for Result.



## Debug Mode

To reduce the amount of output to the log, debug mode was added. Thus, the log in its normal form is concise.
To enable debug mode to see more details, create the FormListManipulator_DEBUG.ini file.

## Examples:
```
ModEvent = TestEvent|BYOHRelationshipAdoptionPlayerGiftChildMale|BYOHChefDoll
Alias = TestAlias|0x8246~HearthFires.esm,0x03008246
Group = Dolls|BYOHChefDoll,BYOHDBDoll,BYOHDragonbornDoll,BYOHJesterDoll
FormList = #TestAlias|BYOHBlacksmithDoll,BYOHDragonPriestDoll,BYOHExecutionerDoll
BToys = #Dolls
Plant = zzzCHMountainFlower01White|zzzCHTreeFloraWhiteFlowers
FormList = 0x03008246|0x807~Plantable Animals.esp,PlantableAnimalsAlbinoSpiderNest
Formlist = #TestAlias|#Dolls
Plant = ChaurusEggs|PlantableAnimalsChaurusNest
```

## Validation for configuration files:
Take a look at the log: "[PATH to MY Documents]\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\SKSE\FormListManipulator.log". It contains all the information about the processed files and records.

## Compatibility

## Benefits
* easy of use - config files instead of plugins,
* no need to create compatibility patches for mods modifying the same list,
* instant effect and better performance (DLL instead of scripts),
* dynamic modification - you can close the game, change the contents of the INI file, and when you run game again, everything will be changed according to the contents of the file,
* ability to use Mod Events, to dynamically modify FormLists during the game.
